# dse511_final_project

Problem:

Part A: Visualizes the timeline of key NASA missions, including Friendship 7 () , Gemini IV, and Apollo 11, highlighting their significant milestones and durations.

Part B: Creates a simplified, hypothetical 3D flight path for Apollo 8, illustrating its Earth orbit, trans-lunar trajectory, lunar orbit, and return to Earth.

Part C: Simulates a hypothetical 3D flight path for Apollo 13, incorporating the trans-lunar trajectory, lunar approach, and the critical Service Module explosion event.

Data:

Part A: I used two different books to gather my data for this section. Those two books are: Apollo 13 by Jim Lovell, who served as Commander of this flight and coauthor Jeffrey Kluger. the other book is A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts. In additon to this, I can send you the pages that support my data.

Part B: Hypothetical data

Part C: hypothetical data

Approach: 

Part A: Visualized the timelines of integral NASA missions, including Friendship 7, Gemini IV, and Apollo 11, highlighting their launch dates, durations, and key milestones.

Part B: Designed a simplified 3D flight path for Apollo 8, illustrating its critical mission phases, including Earth orbit, trans-lunar trajectory, lunar orbit, and the return to Earth.

Part C: Simulated a hypothetical 3D flight path for Apollo 13, incorporating its trans-lunar trajectory, lunar approach, and the Service Module explosion event, which dramatically altered the mission's course.
